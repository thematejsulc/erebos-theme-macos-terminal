## Description
Erebos[^1] is a streamlined theme developed to improve the coding experience
by providing a clean and efficient interface. It focuses on the essential
information and technical touch, enhancing the user's workflow, whether coding
for extended periods or quickly locating a specific line of code.

The primary objective of the development of this theme was to achieve a
subdued appearance with a muted syntax highlighting scheme. Erebos prioritizes
clarity, simplicity, and readability, presenting the relevant information to
the user.

[^1]: The name for the theme, Erebos, is inspired by Greek mythology,
representing the god of darkness and the shadow, fitting for a theme that uses
a dark background to reduce eye strain during extended coding sessions. The
name Erebos also has a mysterious and somewhat ominous feel to it, which is
somewhat appropriate for a theme that prioritizes technical power
and efficiency.
